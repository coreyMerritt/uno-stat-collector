The first thing I'm going to try to determine is at what point the
win percentages start to become stable and static. This is certainly
a question maths and science have asked and answered... but lets answer
it again!

I'll be making slight modifications to the code to append a single line
to a file between every round. This line will contain the win percentage
of one specific random player. After some millions of games run, we'll
try to identify the point at which the win rate becomes stable and stale.
From there, we'll have a firm number of games we want to run every
test against.
